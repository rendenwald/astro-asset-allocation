title: Bold Asset Allocation (BAA) - G12 Balanced
excerpt: BAA combines a slow relative momentum with a fast absolute momentum and crash protection, based on the concept of the ‚Äòcanary‚Äô universe, where we switch from our offensive to the defensive universe when any of the assets in the canary universe has negative absolute momentum.

## Overview

Originally written by Wouter J. Keller in July 2022 in this paper: [Relative and Absolute Momentum in Times of Rising/Low Yields: Bold Asset Allocation (BAA)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4166845).

BAA (Bold Asset Allocation) is a dynamic asset allocation strategy proposed by Wouter J. Keller in 2022. It is a very aggressive strategy that combines the previously proposed PAA, VAA, and DAA.

The canary asset concept of DAA (Defensive Asset Allocation) is used to determine the composition ratio of offensive and defensive assets. However, if any of the four canary assets has negative momentum (breadth parameter B=1), the portfolio is composed only of safe assets, so about 60% of the past test period was composed of defensive assets.

## Strategy features

<DListItem dt="dual-momentum">
  It uses both absolute and relative momentum. Historically, absolute momentum has been effective in minimizing losses, while relative momentum has helped generate better returns.
</DListItem>
<DListItem dt="13612W momentum filter">
  The momentum scoring method as a standard for calculating momentum (1, 3, 6, 12 month average), which allows recent trends to be more weighted and reflected in the momentum calculation. <br />

<DListItem dt="SMA12 momentum filter">
  Slow momentum indicator based on month-end prices from last 13 periods. <br />

<DListItem dt="cash protection">
  In the presented strategy, an important role is played by the capital protection factor, which determines the extent to which the portfolio value should be invested in safe assets, in this case, bonds. <br />

## Strategy rules

1. Calulate 13612W momentum for canary assets.
1. Calculate SMA12 momentum for offenssive and deffenssive assets.
1. If all canary assets have positive momentum, select 6 assets from offenssive asstes with the highest relative momentum.
If any of canary assets have negative momentum then select 3 asset from defensive assets with highest relative momentum.
1. Hold all positions until the last trading day of the next month.
