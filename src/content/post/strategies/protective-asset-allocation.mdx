## Overview

Originally written by Wouter J. Keller and Jan Willem Keuning in April 2016 in this paper: [Protective Asset Allocation (PAA): A Simple Momentum-Based Alternative for Term Deposits](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2759734).

Simple dual-momentum model (called Protective Asset Allocation or PAA) with a vigorous “crash protection” which might fit this bill. It is a tactical variation on the traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio where the optimal stock/bond mix is determined by multi-market breadth using dual momentum. 

## Strategy features

<DListItem dt="dual-momentum">
  It uses both absolute and relative momentum. Historically, absolute momentum has been effective in minimizing losses, while relative momentum has helped generate better returns.
</DListItem>
<DListItem dt="SMA12 momentum filter">
  Slow momentum indicator based on month-end prices from last 13 periods. <br />
  [SMA12 Momentum description](../indicators/momentum#momentum-sma12).
</DListItem>
<DListItem dt="cash protection">
  In the presented strategy, an important role is played by the capital protection factor, which determines the extent to which the portfolio value should be invested in safe assets, in this case, bonds. <br />

## Strategy rules

1. Calculate momentum for offenssive and deffenssive assets.
1. Get list of offenssive assets with positive momentum value.
1. Get list of defensive assets with positive momentum value.
1. Determine the % of the portfolio that is allocated to the “safe” asset.  For this recommendation, the “safe” asset is IEF.  This is done by determining how many “good” and “bad” assets are in our list of funds. n=number of funds with a MOM > 0.
    * If n >= 6, the entire portfolio is invested in the “safe” asset.
    * If n \<= 7: <br />
      The % of the portfolio invested in the “safe” asset = (12- n ) / 6
      The remaining portfolio is divided equally among the 6 assets with the highest MOM score. 
1. Hold all positions until the last trading day of the next month.
