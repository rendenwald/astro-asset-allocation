## Overview

Momentum refers to the tendency of assets or asset classes to exhibit persistent trends in their performance. Tactical asset allocation involves making strategic shifts in the allocation of a portfolio among different asset classes based on short to medium-term market conditions, rather than sticking to a fixed or long-term allocation.

Momentum-based strategies in tactical asset allocation typically involve identifying assets or asset classes that have shown positive performance in recent periods and allocating more capital to those assets. This approach assumes that assets that have performed well in the recent past are more likely to continue their positive performance in the near future.

Here's a simplified explanation of how momentum is used in tactical asset allocation:

- Identifying Momentum: Analyzing historical price movements or other relevant indicators to identify assets or asset classes with positive momentum.
- Allocation Adjustment: Allocating a higher percentage of the portfolio to assets that exhibit positive momentum. This could involve reducing exposure to assets with negative or weakening momentum.
- Rebalancing: Periodically reviewing and adjusting the portfolio allocations based on the latest momentum signals. This allows the portfolio to adapt to changing market conditions.

It's important to note that momentum-based strategies come with risks, and past performance is not always indicative of future results. Markets can be unpredictable, and momentum strategies may not always work as expected. Investors and portfolio managers using such strategies need to carefully analyze market conditions and be aware of the potential limitations and risks associated with momentum-based tactics.

## Momentum 13612W

A 13612W momentum filter used in the Vigilant Asset Allocation (VAA) and Defensive Asset Allocation (DAA) created by Wouter J. Keller and Jan Willem Keuning.

The use of this variant of relative momentum causes the strategy to quickly respond to assets that have the best rate of return in the recent period.

#### 13612W Calculation Method

(Profitability in Last 1 months * 12 + Profitability in Last 3 months * 4 + Profitability in Last 6 months * 2 + Profitability in Last 12 months)/4

## Momentum SMA12

Momentum filter based on SMA (simple moving average) of last 12 months (periods). Every of 12 periods have the same weight.

Current month price (P0) is divided by average of last 12 months (Average(P1:P12)).

####  SMA12 Calculation Method

SMA12(t) = Price at the end of the current month (t)/((Price at the end of the current month (t) + Price at the end of the previous month (t-1) + Price at the end of the previous month (t-2) + ... + 12 months forward Average of the last day price (t-12)) - 1
In other words:
SMA12 = P0/Average(P1:P12) - 1
